# Sea++: Bridging Marine Science and Computation 🌊💻

**Sea++** is a comprehensive platform designed to integrate marine science with computational methodologies. Our mission is to equip marine scientists with the tools and insights needed to utilize the capabilities of contemporary computational techniques, ranging from elementary data analysis to sophisticated machine learning applications.

## Objective 🎯

To furnish marine biology enthusiasts, students, and professionals with resources, tools, and examples to undertake data analysis using Python, and offers an alternative language - Julia. This encompasses a spectrum of tasks from reading and preprocessing data to cutting-edge image recognition techniques specifically designed for marine science applications.
