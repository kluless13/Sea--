## Basic Syntax

### Variables
```julia
x = 10
y = 5.5
z = "Hello, Julia!"
```

### Loops
```julia
for i in 1:5
    println(i)
end
```

### Conditional Statements
```julia
if x > y
    println("x is greater than y")
elseif x < y
    println("x is less than y")
else
    println("x is equal to y")
end
```

### Functions
```julia
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end
```

## Examples

### Matrix Operations
```julia
A = [1 2; 3 4]
B = [2 2; 2 2]
C = A + B
```

### Plotting
To plot in Julia, you can use the `Plots` library.
```julia
using Plots
plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 30, 40], label="linear")
```

## Libraries for Data Analysis

1. **DataFrames.jl**: Provides a set of tools for working with tabular data in Julia. Its design and functionality are similar to pandas in Python.
2. **StatsBase.jl**: Offers basic statistics for Julia: summary statistics, sampling, non-parametric testing, and more.
3. **Plots.jl**: Powerful visualization library. It offers a unified interface for multiple backends.
4. **CSV.jl**: Allows for reading and writing CSV files in Julia.
5. **Distributions.jl**: Provides a suite of functionality for working with probability distributions in Julia.

## Libraries for Data Analysis in Julia

### 1. DataFrames.jl
[DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) is a library that provides a set of tools for working with tabular data in Julia. It's designed to efficiently handle large datasets and offers a range of functionalities similar to `pandas` in Python.

**Key Features:**
- Flexible data manipulation capabilities.
- Supports missing values using the `Missing` type.
- Provides a range of functions for aggregation, grouping, and reshaping data.
- Integration with the `CSV.jl` library for reading and writing data.

**Example:**
```julia
using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(A = 1:4, B = ["M", "F", "F", "M"])
groupby(df, :B)
```

### 2. StatsBase.jl
[StatsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsBase.jl) offers a collection of basic statistics functionalities for Julia. It's a foundational package upon which many other statistical libraries are built.

**Key Features:**
- Descriptive statistics like mean, median, variance, etc.
- Support for weighted statistics.
- Empirical density functions and histograms.
- Non-parametric tests.

**Example:**
```julia
using StatsBase
data = [2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 8]
countmap(data)
```

### 3. Plots.jl
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) is a powerful visualization library for Julia. It provides a unified interface to multiple plotting backends, making it easy to switch between different visualization tools without changing code.

**Key Features:**
- Supports multiple backends like GR, PyPlot, and Plotly.
- Easy to extend and customize plots.
- Provides a consistent interface for creating a wide range of visualizations.

**Example:**
```julia
using Plots
plot(sin, -2π, 2π, label="sin(x)")
```

### 4. CSV.jl
[CSV.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/CSV.jl) is a fast and flexible library to handle CSV files in Julia. It's designed to efficiently read large files and integrates seamlessly with the DataFrames.jl library.

**Key Features:**
- Efficient parsing of large CSV files.
- Supports a wide range of CSV formats and delimiters.
- Provides functionality to write DataFrames to CSV files.

**Example:**
```julia
using CSV
data = CSV.File("data.csv") |> DataFrame
```

### 5. Distributions.jl
[Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) is a library for working with probability distributions and random number generation in Julia.

**Key Features:**
- Supports a wide range of distributions: continuous, multivariate, and discrete.
- Provides functionality for random number generation, density/mass functions, and quantile functions.
- Integrates with other statistical libraries in Julia for more advanced analyses.

**Example:**
```julia
using Distributions
d = Normal(0, 1)
rand(d, 5)
```
